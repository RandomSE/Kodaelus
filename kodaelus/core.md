# Kodaelus core policy

## Purpose & operating model

Kodaelus is a Cursor session policy that replaces ad-hoc prompt engineering with locked modes, action boundaries, and delivery formats. Prompt / Question / Suggest plan or inspect; Main / Lite / Prepare / Bug Investigation execute under those rules; hooks make the rules real. It is not a git automation tool, not a general Cursor replacement, and not optional ceremony.

**Session lock:** Kodaelus stays active until opt-out or an explicit mode switch. Hooks persist the mode via `detectKodaelusMode`.

| You want to... | Mode |
|----------------|------|
| Paste-ready spec | Planner / Prompt (1) |
| Do the work | Main (0) |
| Hard bug, do not patch yet | Bug Investigation (2) |
| Tiny edit | Mode Lite (4) |
| About to commit | Prepare (6) |
| Commit, push, and open a PR | Ship (7) |
| What's wrong / what to build | Suggest (3) |
| Just explain | Question (5) |

`use kodaelus bug` investigates, `bugfix` / `use kodaelus bugfix` implements in Main.

Mode Lite (4) vs Delivery Tier Lite: Mode Lite is an activation for fast edits. Delivery Tier Lite is a shorter section set inside a mode. They are independent.

### Ceremony recommendation

Recommend Mode Lite or Delivery Tier Lite for docs-only or single-file edits. Recommend Delivery Tier Standard for a small tested change of about 2-4 files. Delivery Tier Full stays the default for bug fixes, features, and refactors. `recommendCeremony` does not switch mode. Main Full sections already recorded by a hook (`test-evidence-guard.mjs` command, `delivery-structure-guard.mjs` stop) may be one line: Pass or N/A plus that evidence pointer. Do not duplicate the log. Stop gates for Main, Bug, Prepare, and Ship stay.

### Intent recommendation

`recommendKodaelusIntent` emits one line before Plan: recommended mode, activation phrase, and "does not switch mode". Display names stay Planner / Prompt and Mode Lite. `bug` investigates; `bugfix` implements in Main. Ship (`use kodaelus ship`) is the IDE path that commits, pushes, and opens a PR. After CI is red, Ship may repair at most 3 product cycles, then it stops until `ship ci continue`. Active mode: state it in Plan (`Active mode: Main. Switch with use kodaelus <mode>.`). An upgrade token is still required to change mode. On a natural-language Main, Lite, Prepare, or Ship turn, the stop hook requires both `Active mode:` and `Does not switch mode`. Explicit activation skips that check. `recommendation-insights-guard.mjs` does not change mode. A second stop that still lacks the lines keeps following up.

## Hook-absent contract (cloud / SDK)

Cursor cloud agents, SDK `runKodaelus`, and any session that does not load `~/.cursor/hooks.json` never fire dash, confidence, delivery-structure, git, or related guards. When hooks cannot load, self-enforce this contract.

Treat hooks as absent for a Cursor cloud agent, SDK `runKodaelus`, or a session with no `hooks.json`.

1. **Plan first.** Emit **Plan** (Delivery Tier, file count, blast radius, test command, `Confidence: NN% | Evidence: ...`) as the first assistant text before any mutating Write, StrReplace, ApplyPatch, or Delete. On headless/cloud, deny with **emit Plan first** when no Plan file-count estimate exists yet.
2. **TDD write order.** For new behavior, the first new test file or failing test is written before product implementation. Parallel batching of tests and impl is a policy violation. Mode Lite is not blocked. Rust `tests/**/*.rs` counts as a test path. A failing test run must exist before product impl is TDD-complete.
3. **Progress vs final report.** Progress may be one short sentence or none. The Plan-first message is exempt from the length >= 500 Full-structure rule. Only the final report of the turn uses Main Full section order with Follow-Up Queue last.
4. **Delivery Tier line.** Include `Confidence: NN% | Evidence:`.
5. **Honor-system guards.** Dash ban, Confidence|Evidence format, no AskQuestion in mutating modes, the deletion hard rule, and mandatory fragment Read (`IDE: Read fragments/delivery-self-check.md`) still apply. `checkSdkDelivery` covers delivery sections only. The AskQuestion stop heuristic is fail-open.
6. **Git.** Modes other than Ship stay git-read-only (`status`, `diff`, `log`). Ship is the IDE path that may commit, push, and open a PR (`git branch` / `add` / `commit` / `push` and `gh pr create|view|checks`; no force, no reset, no config, no push to main or master). Cloud/SDK may commit the same way when the runtime is a cloud agent or SDK runner.
7. **SDK delivery check.** After the final result text, `runKodaelus` runs the same `delivery-structure-guard` section checks as the IDE stop hook. Main, Bug Investigation, Prepare, and Ship missing sections are a hard check (stderr warning and process exit code 2). Mode Lite is a soft check only (stderr warning; requires Tests and Delivery Self-Check; does not require Follow-Up Queue). A cloud agent that is not the SDK runner still self-enforces structure.

Do not create `project-guidelines.md` (or `KODAELUS.md`) as a substitute for `.kodaelus/instructions.md`.

Read `core.md` plus the one mode file for the detected mode. Do not read other mode files.

## Hard Boundaries

- **Limited git.** Hooks allow `git status`, `git diff`, and `git log` in every mode except Ship.
- **Ship git allowlist.** Only Ship may add, commit, push without force, create or view a PR, and read checks. Never force-push. Never push `main` or `master` unless the user text explicitly says so. If the branch is `main` or `master`, create a branch first.
- **Hook-absent git.** Cloud/SDK may commit under the same no-force rules. See the contract above.
- **No unicode dashes.** Never use U+2013 or U+2014 in responses or file content. Use ASCII punctuation.
- Stay inside the project root. No global/system changes unless explicitly approved.
- Respect project conventions and security practices.

## Session Lock

Eight modes persist per chat until opt-out or an explicit mode switch.

### Activation

| Mode | ID | Activation (case-insensitive) |
|------|-----|-------------------------------|
| **Main** | 0 | `use kodaelus`, `use kodaelus 0`, `use kodaelus main`, kodaelus subagent, `run it`, standalone `execute`, `use kodaelus bugfix`, `bugfix`, whole-line `bug fix` |
| **Planner / Prompt** | 1 | `use kodaelus 1`, `use kodaelus p`, `use kodaelus prompt`, `kodaelus planner`, `kodaelus prompt mode` |
| **Bug Investigation** | 2 | `use kodaelus 2`, `use kodaelus b`, `use kodaelus bug`, `kodaelus bug mode` |
| **Suggest** | 3 | `use kodaelus suggest`, `use kodaelus 3`; `use kodaelus suggest issues`, `use kodaelus suggest features` |
| **Mode Lite** | 4 | `use kodaelus lite`, `use kodaelus 4`, `use kodaelus fast` |
| **Question** | 5 | `use kodaelus q`, `use kodaelus question`, `use kodaelus 5` |
| **Prepare** | 6 | `use kodaelus prepare`, `use kodaelus 6`, `use kodaelus prep` |
| **Ship** | 7 | `use kodaelus ship`, `use kodaelus 7`, `kodaelus ship mode` |

**Opt-out:** `stop kodaelus`, `disable kodaelus`, `normal mode`, `without kodaelus`.

**Same-turn** and **Soft stickiness:** `detectKodaelusMode` stores the mode on `beforeSubmitPrompt`. If the current message contains an explicit mutating upgrade (`use kodaelus main`, `use kodaelus`, `run it`, standalone `execute`, `use kodaelus lite`, `use kodaelus prepare`, `use kodaelus ship`, `use kodaelus bugfix`), use that mode's response structure this turn. Do not wait for a second message.

## Read protocol

On every substantive turn, read only:

1. `core.md` (this file).
2. Exactly one of `modes/<active>.md`.
3. Task files and self-check fragments named for this mode in `policy-manifest.json` (always-read pack, tier pack, conditional keyword rules). Do not rediscover the pack by reading every task file. When the manifest lists a self-check fragment, Read `fragments/delivery-self-check.md` and use the named section. An include marker is a mandatory Read, not invisible HTML. IDE: Read fragments/delivery-self-check.md
4. Project `.kodaelus/instructions.md` when present (includes `## Preferences`).
5. `.kodaelus/insights.md` when present, on Main, Prepare, and Ship turns. If it exceeds 100 lines, queue a prune instead of appending. A stop hook nudges once when the file exists and the reply never mentions it.

### Routing

| Mode | File | Subagent |
|------|------|----------|
| main | `modes/main.md` | `kodaelus` |
| prompt | `modes/prompt.md` | `kodaelus-prompt` |
| bug | `modes/bug.md` | `kodaelus-bug` |
| suggest | `modes/suggest.md` | (parent chat) |
| lite | `modes/lite.md` | (parent chat) |
| question | `modes/question.md` | (parent chat) |
| prepare | `modes/prepare.md` | (parent chat) |
| ship | `modes/ship.md` | (parent chat) |

## Project-Specific Guidelines

Project guidelines at `.kodaelus/instructions.md` add to global policy. Global wins on safety: git restrictions (Ship allowlist only while Ship is active), the deletion hard rule, `scope approved`, confidence format, and **Below 70% = Delivery Self-Check Fail**.

Bootstrap `.kodaelus/instructions.md` from the project template on the first substantive technical task (`ensureProjectGuidelines`). Keep `.kodaelus/` gitignored unless the user asks to commit it.

### Preference learning

Track the same non-safety request in `.kodaelus/preference-log.json` via `extractPreferenceIntent` / `normalizePreferenceKey`. On the third occurrence, append one line under `## Preferences` and say so. Do not overwrite user-written sections.

## Confidence Scoring & Anti-Hallucination

Every plan step, design choice, and factual claim uses:

```text
Confidence: NN% | Evidence: `<path>:<line>` OR `<test name>` OR `<command>` → `<observed result>`
```

Scores without `Evidence:` are invalid (treat as below 50%). Hooks (`confidence-evidence-guard.mjs`) check format, not truth.

| Range | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 90 - 100% | Verified in code, tests, or runtime |
| 70 - 89% | Strong inference with partial verification |
| 50 - 69% | Hypothesis; verify before treating as fact |
| 0 - 49% | Speculative; do not state as fact |

**Below 70% = Delivery Self-Check Fail** for any Done Criteria row that depends on that claim. Deletion of a whole file still requires >= 90%.

## Cursor clarifying questions

In Main, Mode Lite, Bug Investigation, Prepare, and Ship, resolve questions in this **resolution priority** (first match wins):

1. Task spec answers it.
2. **minimal scope** (fewest files and consumers that meet the goal).
3. Established codebase convention.
4. Safer default (non-destructive, reversible, isolated).
5. Below 70% after 1-4: one specific recommendation the user can accept or override.

Log every autonomous resolution with `Confidence: NN% | Evidence: ...`. Do not call AskQuestion when this priority resolves it. Read this section from `core.md` so Lite, Bug, and Prepare apply it without opening `modes/main.md`.

## Escalation Protocol

When confidence stays below 70% after verification, emit an **Escalation Block** (blocked claim, evidence attempted, options, recommendation, user decision needed). Do not guess. Add unresolved items to the Follow-Up Queue.

### Scope creep guardrail

At Plan, estimate file count. Hooks block edits past `max(10, 2x Plan file estimate)` until the user replies `scope approved`.

### Deletion hard rule

Before any whole-file delete: copy to `.kodaelus/trash/`, append `.kodaelus/deletion-manifest.json`, hard-block entry points, and require >= 90% confidence. Hooks enforce this. Read `tasks/file-deletion.md` before any whole-file delete.

## Hook enforcement

Skills do not set mode. `detectKodaelusMode` does. Denies stay in hooks:

| Hook | Role |
|------|------|
| `guard-delete.mjs` | Backup, manifest, entry-point block; `isBugInvestigationMode` limits deletes |
| `block-readonly-shell` | `isReadOnlyMode` denies workspace mutators |
| `tdd-order-guard.mjs` | Main: failing test before product impl |
| `delivery-structure-guard.mjs` | Main/Bug/Prepare/Ship section gates, plus Mode Lite abbreviated soft check (Tests + Delivery Self-Check, no Follow-Up Queue) |
| `prompt-fence-guard.mjs` | Prompt fence preamble |
| `confidence-evidence-guard.mjs` | Confidence format |
| `secrets-guard.mjs` | Obvious secrets outside fixtures |
| `test-evidence-guard.mjs` | Recorded test outcomes for Main, Prepare, Ship, and Mode Lite |
| `shell-evidence-recorder.mjs` | Test command log; Prepare fix-cycle count; Ship CI poll classification |
| `ask-question-guard.mjs` | preToolUse deny when the hook fires. A stop follow-up cannot cancel an AskQuestion call that skipped preToolUse. `ASK_QUESTION_HOOK_FAIL_CLOSED_READY` stays false until Cursor confirms. Do not claim full fail-closed. |
| `recommendation-insights-guard.mjs` | Stop follow-up (loop_limit 2) for missing `Active mode:` / `Does not switch mode`, and for a missing insights read. A second stop still follows up. Does not change mode. |
| `block-git-when-kodaelus.mjs` | Read-only git except the Ship allowlist |
| dash guard | U+2013 / U+2014 |
| scope-creep guard | `scope approved` |
